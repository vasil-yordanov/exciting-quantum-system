# Time-Dependent 1D Schrödinger Equation

The time-dependent 1D Schrödinger equation is given by:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x, t) \Psi(x, t)
$$

where:
- Ψ(x, t) is the wave function of the particle.
- ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
- m is the mass of the particle.
- V(x, t) is the potential energy as a function of position x and time t.
